## 🚛 Telematics + AI: Predictive Toll & Damage Attribution in Logistics

This project develops an **AI-powered predictive system** that integrates **telematics data** and **image classification** to transform cost attribution, toll aggregation, and damage tracking in the freight logistics model.

### 📌 Objective
To **automate trailer toll attribution** and **enhance damage detection** by combining IoT-based telematics with deep learning models for image analysis.

### 🔍 Key Features
- 📡 Real-time **telematics data ingestion** for trip segmentation and toll mapping  
- 🧠 Deep learning–based **image classification** to detect and assess trailer damage  
- 🔗 Automated **cost attribution** to the correct stakeholders in the logistics chain  
- 📊 Improved **operational transparency** and **dispute resolution accuracy**

### 🎯 Impact
Our solution enhances accountability and cost control, reduces manual intervention, and paves the way for smarter, data-driven freight operations.
